# Integration Checklist
Integrating the fiskaltrust.Middleware involves several steps, from calling the API the right way to registering in the production fiskaltrust.Portal and connecting to Dealers. To simplify this process for POS Creators, we've composed a concise checklist that can be used to validate if all required steps were succesfully performed.

|   ![Germany](images/flag-de.png)   | **_(Recommended):_ Open TSE transactions are properly handled**                 | In the daily business it's possible that some transactions stay open in the TSE. Most of the time this is caused by the finish-transaction not reaching the TSE. Reasons for this are often: network errors, a unplugged TSE or a power outage. If these transactions stay open at the time of the daily-closing then the Middleware won't be able to delete the exported TSE-Logs (content of the TAR-file) and therefore the size of the exported TAR grows in size every export. Since the TAR is saved in the local Middleware database, the database can reach mutliple Gigabyte in size. By law the maximum limit of open transactions is 500. When this limit is reached, the TSE won't sign any new transaction. To prevent this, we strongly recommend to implement the following process flow into your interagtion: Before sending a daily-closing-receipt... (1) send a [Zero-Receipt with TSE-Info](https://middleware-samples.docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/#b19ee780-b02b-478c-9690-80f8579888a4) to the queue. The ftState property of the response will then contain the CurrentStartedTransactionNumbers. (2) close this array of open transactions using a [Failed-Receipt(for multiple transactions)](https://middleware-samples.docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/#fa98dfa2-231d-4437-8086-5987b3a42117)
